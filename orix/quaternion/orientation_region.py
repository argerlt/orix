    determinant of 1, or various other descriptors based on the
    application.

    Sometimes, this whole space is not needed, for example if the
    orientation of an object is constrained or (most commonly) if the
    object is symmetrical. In this case, the space can be segmented
    using set of rotations representing boundaries in the space. This
    can be most easily visualized using Rodrigues space, where the
    boundaries become flat planes normal to the rodrigues vectors of
    those bounding rotations.

    Notes

    Notably, these regions are only defined in *SO(3)*, which means they
    cannot account for improper operations. This is why
    :meth:`from_symmetry` calculates identical regions for point groups
    *432* and *m-3m* despite *m-3m* having twice as many distinguished
    points. This ends up being irrelevant for orientations since any
    improper operation that places a point within a fundamental zone
    always has a paired proper operation that returns an identical
    quaternion, but it can create confusion for misorientations with
    rotoinversions when we assume an orientation region can uniquely
    define a true fundamental zone.

        Notes
        -----
        These regions are identical to the fundamental zone (FZ) for all
        orientations and every misorientation where both symmetries are
        proper and/or centrosymmetric. For all other cases, it is still
        garunteed to inlude only one unique representation achievable
        through proper rotations.

        orix follows the FZ definitions described in
        :cite:`krakow2017onthree`, except when it comes to handling of
        improper symmetry elements. As described in section 3(b) of that
        paper, FZ boundaries created by improper rotations represent
        operations that cannot be achieved through rigid body rotations.
        As a result, it is often appropriate to ignore these elements, a
        practice orix also defaults to in operations such as orientation
        :meth:`~orix.quaternion.Orientation.reduce` and
        :meth:`~orix.quaternion.Orientation.mean`.

        However, in order to support the rare exceptions where improper
        FZ boundaries might be relevant (for example, grain boundary
        misorientation distributions between non-centrosymmetric
        crystals), orix allows defining FZs that include improper
        elements for all 1024 possible combinations of two symmetries.

        For 704 combinations, including all orientations and any
        misorientation with centrosymmetry, this is irrelevant as
        both methods exactly reduce to the same 121 cases described in
        :cite:`krakow2017onthree`. For the remaining 320 combinations
        where one or both point groups contain rotoinversions but are
        not centrosymmetric (for example, *6mm* --> *6mm*), there are
        always one and possibly two improper rotations that also map to
        the FZ but with unique quaternion values, as well as a possible
        unique pseudo-proper rotation only achievable through two
        rotoinversions. In these cases, orix will return the FZ bounding
        the unique proper and pseudo-proper representations.
